# Week2 Task - Converting two different cent values into one euro amount

# Need to convert input into an integer 

amount_one = int(input("Enter amount in cents "))
amount_two = int(input("Enter second amount in cents "))

total_amount = amount_one + amount_two
#Convert to euros
euro_value = total_amount / 100
# Can only concatenate str (not "float") to str
print("â‚¬" + str(euro_value))
